// Variables are like "Labeled Jars" for a value in JavaScript. We can store a value and give it a name, so that we can recall it, use it, or change it later on
let someName0 = value;
// We can also store multiple values in one variable.
let someName = value1;
let someName2 = value2;
let age = 72;
age; // 72

let hens = 4;
let roosters = 2;
hens + roosters; // 6

hens - 1; // 3, but doest change the value of the variable
hens = hens - 1; // 3, but changes the value of the variable

// Variables has some reserved words, so I can not use them. Examples: document, window, console, alert, etc.
// Naming is very important in JavaScript.
// We can use camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase, or any other way we want, BUT, the convention is for camelCase;
// If we crate a variable with a given name using, we cannot then redeclare it.
// let age = 56 // I cannot redeclare age
